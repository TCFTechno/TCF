Array 


int arr[]=new int[5];


arr[0]=1;
arr[1]=1;
arr[2]=1;
arr[3]=1;
arr[4]=1;




Collections 


it will support dissimilar data types
no memory wastage
it will aallows dynamic memory allocation





1. List 

ArrayList - class



Linkedlist - class




2. Set

3. MAp



List list=new ArrayList();

1. it is index based -- 

2. insertion order

3. it allows duplicates

4. it support generics

value will print in square bracket 


add()  =   to add value into arraylist we use add method 

get() =  passing index value we can get the array list value  

clear() = it wil clear all the Arraylist value

size() = it will get the length of the ararylist


remove() = by passing the index 


set() =  by passing the existing index value we can upadte the value


contains() = it will check the values present in arraylist or not


indexof()=  using this method we can get the index position of the value.

first value have the prefrences



addall() == using addall() we can copy all the value into another arraylist


removeall()  == it is used to compare the both list and remove the duplicate value in list

list2=list2-list1; 


retainall()=  it wil compare 2 arraylist and print the commaon value
